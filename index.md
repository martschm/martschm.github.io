## [Diploma Thesis - Financial and Actuarial Mathematics (R)](/diploma_thesis)

Summary of the main results (including R-Code) of my diploma thesis *'Aggregation of Integer-Valued Risks with Copula Induced Dependency Structure'* at the [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) under the supervision of [Dr. Uwe Schmock](https://fam.tuwien.ac.at/~schmock/).

## [Web-Scraping using Scrapy (Python)](/web_scraping_using_scrapy)

This project serves to demonstrate web scraping in Python using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) on the example of [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com). URL, publication date, title and text of the news articles are stored in a pandas dataframe.

## [NLP - Topic Modeling (Python)](/nlp_topic_modeling)

For this project I have scraped news articles from [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/news/archive/euro-zone-news) and clustered them using [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation). Since there is no proper classification of articles on Reuters, my model supports the reader in finding articles relating to a specific topic. Furthermore, the model could be used to classify future articles as well. Graphical results can be found [here](/nlp_topic_modeling/lda_final.html).

## [Route Optimization - Brute Force (Python)](/python_route_optimization)

The program gets as input a csv-file with locations (longitude and latitude) and determines the best route (based on time or distance) starting from a specified location using [Google's Distance Matrix API](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python/blob/master/googlemaps).

<! --- ## [Simple VIX Modeling (Python)](/ubs_quant_assignment)

<! --- The problem statement for this project comes from [UBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS) and is part of an assignment for quantitative analysts. In a nutshell, the goal was to build a simple prediction model for [VIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX) (volatility index) using predefined indices (e.g. SP500, NASDAQ, CPI).
