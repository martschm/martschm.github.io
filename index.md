## [Route Optimization - Brute Force (Python)](/python_route_optimization)

The program gets as input a csv-file with locations (longitude and latitude) and determines the best route (based on time or distance) starting from a specified location using [Google's Distance Matrix API](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python/blob/master/googlemaps).

## [Web-Scraping using Scrapy (Python)](/web_scraping_using_scrapy)

This project serves to demonstrate web scraping in Python using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) on the example of [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com). URL, publication date, title and text of the news articles are stored in a pandas dataframe.

## [NLP - Topic Modeling (Python)](/nlp_topic_modeling)

For this project I have scraped news articles from [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/news/archive/euro-zone-news) and clustered them using [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation). Since there is no proper classification of articles on Reuters, my model supports the reader in finding articles relating to a specific topic. Furthermore, the model could be used to classify future articles as well. Graphical results can be found [here](/nlp_topic_modeling/lda_final.html).
