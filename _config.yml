I hold a Master's degree in Financial and Actuarial Mathematics from the Vienna University of Technology (graduation with highest distinction) 
and have been working as a Quantitative Credit Risk Manager within an international banking group in Austria for more than 4 years. 
Recently, I joined the Austrian National Bank as an Examiner for internal credit risk models of significant institutions. 
I have excellent programming and database (Python, R, SAS, SQL) as well as statistical/mathematical skills and gained hands-on machine learning 
experience during various Data Science Hackathons (amongst others: Winner of the ‘Coding Challenge on Risk Management‘ hosted by the European Central Bank).
