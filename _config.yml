  I studied financial and actuarial mathematics at the Vienna University of Technology and
  have been working as a Credit Risk Manager in the banking sector in Austria for more than
  3 years, where I use my profound quantitative/programming skills in a profitable way for
  the benefit of my company.
  My quick comprehension and high willingness to learn characterize me as a person.
